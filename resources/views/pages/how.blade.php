          <h1 class="display-3">How does this all work?</h1>
          <p>Blockchain Notes is a note taking app that stores all of the major contents of each note on a Blockchain-Based network called IPFS, more specifically through an API called <a href="https://web3.storage" target="_blank">Web3</a>.</p>
          <p>The point of this is so this information is not owned by anyone, meaning more anomynity and more redundancy.</p>
          <p>All information besides the name and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/" target="_blank">CID</a> are stored in the blockchain network. This means that the data is owned by noone, if I shutdown this website you would still be able to access the data through IPFS via the CID. I am working on a way to export these securely.</p> 
          <p>Another good thing about using this is that the storage is completely free, although I know Web3 has plans to eventually have a very small fee since they are paying for the upkeep of the APIs. Even then this will be absolutely nothing compared to normal storage fees.</p>
